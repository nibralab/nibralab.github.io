**nibralab** is a non-profit division of [BSDS](http://bsds.de).
It was created as a think tank, where ideas are investigated and documented, which are used throughout the BSDS divisions
[GreenCape](http://greencape.github.io) (development related stuff), [laJoom](http://laJoom.com) (extension development), and
BSDS (consulting) itself.
